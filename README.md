# full-stack-project

This is a website to where you can create a hiking trip to national parks in the eastern and western United States. All you need to do is fill in the sign up page, login, and go to the trips page to begin. The sign up information will go to a database. The login page will read that information from the database. Select a region and start and end times, and it will show you a list of national parks you can go to. The itinerary page is not fully functional, but you have the standard Create and Read from CRUD.
